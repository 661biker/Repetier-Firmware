V 0.91.21 (2014-04-28)
- Improved clean-up and output of the object after a stop of the printing from the SD card.
- Minor clean-ups and corrections.

V 0.91.19 (2014-04-17)
- Moving of the z-axis via the hardware buttons supports acceleration and allows faster speeds now.
- Manual outputting of filament (via the Host software and/or via the hardware button) could cause an unwanted emergency pause.
- When the printing is paused, the extruder current is lowered now.
  - EXTRUDER_CURRENT_PAUSED can be used in order to configure the to-be-used current while the printing is paused.
  - EXTRUDER_CURRENT_PAUSE_DELAY can be used in order to configure after which time interval in status "paused" the extruder current shall be lowered.
- Output object has been changed so that it moves into z-direction first and into x and y direction afterwards.
- The entry "Bed Temp" has been removed from the quick settings.
- In case the printing via the SD card is active, the quick menu provides the "Stop Print" entry now which can be used in order to cancel the print.
- The order of the entries within the quick settings menu has been changed.
- Stopping of the print via the menu now also disables all heaters, outputs the object and disables all steppers.
  - All steppers are disabled also after a manual "Output Object".
- Improved initialization of the display.

V 0.91.17 (2014-03-27)
- Correcting of the comments about the DRV8711 register settings.

V 0.91.15 (2014-03-26)
- Adding of averaging to the pressure measurement for the emergency pause.
  - EMERGENCY_PAUSE_INTERVAL can be used in order to configure the interval at which the emergency pause functionality shall determine the current pressure
  - EMERGENCY_PAUSE_CHECKS can be used in order to configure the number of measurements which shall be averaged
- The minimal and maximal allowed pause pressure can be configured separately now.
  - See EMERGENCY_PAUSE_DIGITS_MIN and EMERGENCY_PAUSE_DIGITS_MAX.
- Changing of the configuration of the DRV8711 drivers in order to achieve a more precise stepping.
- Adding of a configurable delay after enabling of the x/y/z/extruder steppers.
  - STEPPER_ON_DELAY can be used in order to configure the to-be-used delay.

V 0.91.13 (2014-03-16)
- Adding of M3110, which allows to lock the currently shown status text.

V 0.91.11 (2014-03-05)
- All acceleration values within the "Configuration" -> "Acceleration" menu can be increased by 100 now.
- At the end of the heat bed scan, the status display provides information about whether the scan was successful or whether it had to be aborted.
- The menu option "Set to Origin" has been disabled (via the FEATURE_SET_TO_ORIGIN definition).
- The "Quick Settings" -> "Home All" operation has been disabled during the print.
- "M3070 S2" (= pause print and move away) has been corrected so that the printing can be continued properly again.

V 0.91.09 (2014-02-04)
- Minor adaptations for the hardware support.

V 0.91.07 (2014-01-27)
